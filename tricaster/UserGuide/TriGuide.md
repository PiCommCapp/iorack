#### Operation

### Engineering Computer

The Engineering computer hosts services for the setup and monitor of the IO system. 

One Primary purpose is to act as the NDI Router. It does this by running [ZEN NDI Router](https://www.ndistuff.uk/zen-ndi-router-remote-panel/). Zen must be started after the computer is started. This can be done with a local keyboard and screen, or using MS Remote Desktop at the PC's IP address. Once the router software is running select "Load Config" and load the config from the desktop.

The PC also hosts the [system webpage](http://192.168.10.12:3000).
